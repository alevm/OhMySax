          I play saxophone. Not well — but enough to know what a great horn feels like under
          your fingers, and enough to care when a vintage instrument sits in a case, unplayable,
          because nobody wants to take on the repair.
        </p>
        <p>
          OhMySax is my project to learn vintage saxophone repair from the ground up. Not in a school.
          Not as an apprentice (yet). Just hands-on, horn by horn, mistake by mistake.

          <h3>Horn #1 — The Education</h3>
          <p>
            My first saxophone. Very old, very rusty, very hard to work on. I learned more from
            this one instrument than from any book or video. The horn is currently unusable — but
            the learning was invaluable. Dent removal, pad work, key alignment — all attempted,
            most failed, all understood better afterward.

          <p>
            A more forgiving patient. Disassembled, cleaned, mostly repadded. Not quite finished.
            Getting closer to a playable result. This one taught me patience and the difference
            between "looks right" and "seals right."

      <h2>Why Vintage Saxophones</h2>

      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          Modern horns are precision-manufactured and mostly excellent out of the box. Vintage
          horns — Conn, King, Buescher, Martin, SML, early Selmers — were built differently.
          Heavier brass, hand-engraved bells, keywork that feels different under your fingers.
          Many of them sit in attics and closets because the cost of professional repair exceeds
          what people think they're worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think they're worth it. I'm learning to prove that with my hands.

      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          Right now this is a learning project. Eventually — maybe — it becomes something more.
          A small repair practice. A way to bring dead horns back to life. A craft that doesn't
          depend on screens, servers, or software.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I'm documenting what I learn, one horn at a time.

        <p>
          I'm Andrea. I live in Barcelona. By day I work in tech infrastructure. By evening I play
          saxophone (badly) and build electronic instruments. OhMySax is the part of my life where
          I work with my hands on something that was built to last a hundred years.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a vintage horn that needs attention and you're patient enough to let a learner
          try — or if you know someone in Barcelona who repairs saxophones and might tolerate an
          enthusiastic apprentice — I'd love to hear from you.
